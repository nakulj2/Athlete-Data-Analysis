# Athlete-Data-Analysis


This code snippet demonstrates the data preprocessing, visualization, and linear regression modeling using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, missingno, plotly, numpy, and scikit-learn.


# Getting Started
Install the required libraries: pandas, seaborn, missingno, plotly, numpy, and scikit-learn.
Ensure that the 'data.xlsx' file is present in the working directory or provide the actual file path in the code.
Run the code sequentially in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or any Python IDE.
Code Explanation
Data Loading:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the data from the 'data.xlsx' file into a pandas DataFrame.
It uses the pd.read_csv() function to read the data into the DataFrame called df.
Data Preprocessing:

The code performs various data preprocessing steps:
Dropping unnecessary columns using df.drop().
Removing duplicates using df.drop_duplicates().
Handling missing values by filling them with 0 using df.fillna(0).
Cleaning column names by replacing spaces with underscores using df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(' ', '_').
Data Visualization:

The code uses seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visualize the data:
Visualizing missing values using msno.bar(df).
Creating count plots and pie charts to visualize categorical variables using sns.countplot() and data.plot(kind='pie').
Creating bar plots and scatter plots to explore relationships between variables using sns.barplot() and sns.scatterplot().
Linear Regression Modeling:

The code demonstrates a simple linear regression modeling using scikit-learn:
Importing the required classes from scikit-learn.
Preparing the data by separating the features and the target variable.
Splitting the data into training and test sets using train_test_split().
Scaling the features using StandardScaler().
Training the linear regression model using LinearRegression().
Evaluating the model's accuracy using the coefficient of determination (R-squared) with model.score().

#Conclusion
This code provides a basic example of data preprocessing, visualization, and linear regression modeling using Python. It can be used as a starting point for analyzing and modeling similar datasets. Feel free to modify the code and adapt it to your specific requirements.
